    2. Naive Bayes
    3. Neural Network

Tag feature:
Performed one-hot encoding to all the tags, value 1 if contains the tag, o otherwise.

Visual & audio features:
Extracted features and transform to NumPy array.

Modelling:
Used sklearn to perform data modelling.

Evaluation:
Imported sklearn.metrics to show the evaluated result.
